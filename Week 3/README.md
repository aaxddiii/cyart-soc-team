## ⚠️ Lab Execution Note (Important)

This Week 3 SOC lab was conducted on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS virtual machine running on Oracle VirtualBox using an ASUS SonicMaster (2017) laptop.

Due to OS version limitations, legacy dependencies, and hardware constraints, some modern SOC tools (Elastic Security, Wazuh Manager, TheHive) could not be fully deployed or executed as intended. Multiple installation and service startup attempts were made; however, compatibility issues prevented stable runtime execution.

As a SOC intern, the focus of this exercise was placed on:
- Understanding SOC workflows
- Log analysis methodology
- Threat intelligence integration concepts
- Incident escalation procedures
- Documentation and reporting standards

All tasks were completed using:
- Configuration attempts
- Command execution trials
- Log samples
- Simulated datasets
- Industry-standard documentation practices

This reflects real-world SOC scenarios where analysts frequently rely on documentation, partial telemetry, and theoretical correlation when tooling is unavailable or degraded.
