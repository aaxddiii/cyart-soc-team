Log Correlation Activity

Objective:
To correlate authentication failure events with suspicious outbound network activity to detect possible brute-force or compromised account behavior.

Process Followed:
Imported Windows authentication logs and firewall logs into Elastic Security.
Focused on Event ID 4625 (Failed Login).
Matched timestamps with outbound DNS and TCP traffic.
Observed repeated login failures followed by external DNS queries.

Correlation Table
Timestamp	           Event ID	    Source IP	   Destination IP	           Notes
2025-08-18 12:00:00	   4625	    192.168.1.100	    8.8.8.8	      Suspicious DNS request
2025-08-18 12:01:10	   4625	    192.168.1.100    	8.8.4.4	      Repeated outbound traffic
 
Observation: Repeated authentication failures followed by external DNS traffic may indicate credential testing or malware beaconing.
