This incident involved a simulated exploitation of a Samba vulnerability on a test system within a controlled lab environment. Detection was achieved through Wazuh alerts,
followed by manual triage and validation using correlated logs and threat intelligence. The affected system was immediately isolated to prevent further compromise. 
No evidence of data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms was identified. This exercise demonstrated the importance of layered monitoring, timely alert escalation, and 
proper incident documentation. Recommendations include regular patching of exposed services, continuous monitoring of authentication events, and improved threat intelligence
integration to enhance early detection capabilities.
