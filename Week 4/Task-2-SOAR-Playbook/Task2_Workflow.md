# Task 2 – SOAR Playbook Development

## Objective
To design and validate a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) playbook for handling phishing incidents in a SOC environment.


## SOAR Scope
This task focused on:
- Playbook design and logic
- Tool integration planning
- Response automation reasoning

Due to system constraints, full Splunk Phantom execution was not performed. Instead, the playbook was designed and validated using Elastic Security, TheHive, and threat intelligence workflows.


## Incident Type
- Phishing attack
- Malicious IP / hash indicator
- High-severity SOC alert
