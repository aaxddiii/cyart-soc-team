# Task 2 – SOAR Playbook Development

## Context

Full SOAR platforms such as Splunk Phantom were not deployed due to system and resource constraints. Instead, this task was completed by
**designing and documenting a realistic SOAR workflow**, which reflects how many SOC teams plan automation before implementation.


## Incident Type Chosen
Phishing Incident

This was chosen because:
- It is high-frequency in SOC environments
- It benefits the most from automation
- It integrates well with threat intelligence and case management


## Playbook Logic (Designed)

1. Phishing alert is generated by SIEM
2. Indicators (IP / hash / URL) are extracted
3. Indicators are validated using threat intelligence
4. Confirmed malicious indicators are blocked
5. Incident is documented and tracked in TheHive


## Outcome

Although not executed via a live SOAR engine, this playbook demonstrates:
- Orchestration logic
- Automation opportunities
- Response standardization

This mirrors real SOC environments where playbooks are often documented before automation rollout.
