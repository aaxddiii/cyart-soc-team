# Metrics Analysis and Insights – Task 7

## Observations
- Detection occurred within a reasonable timeframe
- Response time was longer due to manual validation steps
- No false positives were escalated to containment


## SOC Maturity Assessment
- Detection capability: Moderate to Good
- Response capability: Developing
- Automation level: Low


## Improvement Opportunities
- Automate phishing containment actions
- Improve alert prioritization
- Enhance email filtering to reduce dwell time


## Key Insight
Metrics are not just numbers; they reveal process bottlenecks and improvement opportunities within SOC operations.
