# Executive Summary – SOC Metrics Report

During the evaluation period, the SOC handled a simulated phishing incident to assess detection and response effectiveness.
The Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) was measured at approximately two hours, indicating adequate visibility into malicious activity.
However, the Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) extended to four hours, primarily due to manual validation and decision-making steps.

While no operational impact occurred, the analysis highlighted opportunities to improve response efficiency through automation
and better alert prioritization. Reducing response time would directly lower attacker dwell time and organizational risk.

Overall, the SOC demonstrates solid detection capabilities but would benefit from increased automation and streamlined workflows to
improve response performance and resilience.
