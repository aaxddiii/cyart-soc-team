# Detection Gaps and Improvement Areas – Task 6

## Identified Gaps
- No automated adversary simulation tooling deployed
- Limited endpoint telemetry due to absence of EDR
- Detection relies heavily on analyst-driven correlation


## Recommended Improvements
- Deploy MITRE Caldera in a dedicated emulation lab
- Integrate EDR telemetry for behavioral detection
- Expand SOAR automation for phishing containment
- Create ATT&CK-aligned detection coverage matrix


## SOC Maturity Insight
This exercise highlighted that effective emulation is not only about executing attacks, but about validating detection logic,
response readiness, and documentation quality.
