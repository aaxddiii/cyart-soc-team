# Task 4 – Limitations and Key Learnings

## Tool Limitations Encountered

- TheHive Community Edition does not support built-in analyzers
- Automated enrichment and task workflows are limited
- No direct SOAR integrations available without paid modules

These limitations prevented full automation but did not block proper alert triage.


## How Limitations Were Addressed

- Manual threat intelligence validation was performed
- Case notes and documentation were emphasized
- Focus was placed on analyst reasoning rather than automation


## Key Learnings

- Case management is as important as detection
- Threat intelligence significantly reduces false positives
- SOC work often requires adaptation when tooling is limited
- Documentation quality reflects analyst maturity
