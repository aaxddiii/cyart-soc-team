# Task 3 – Post-Incident Analysis

## Incident Overview

A mock phishing incident was used to conduct post-incident analysis. The goal was not forensic depth, but understanding
**why the incident occurred and how to improve**.


## Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

The analysis identified user interaction and weak email filtering as primary contributors. This reflects common real-world findings
rather than technical exploitation.


## Metrics Evaluation

- MTTD: 2 hours
- MTTR: 4 hours

These values were selected to simulate a reasonably functioning SOC while still leaving room for improvement.


## Lessons Learned

The incident highlighted that:
- User awareness is critical
- Preventive controls matter as much as detection
- Metrics help measure SOC maturity, not perfection
