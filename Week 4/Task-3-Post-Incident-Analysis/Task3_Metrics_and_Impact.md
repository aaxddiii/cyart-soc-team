# Metrics and Impact Assessment – Task 3

## Incident Metrics

| Metric                      | Value   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)  | 2 hours |
| Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) | 4 hours |
| Dwell Time                  | 2 hours |


## Impact Analysis
- No confirmed system compromise
- No business disruption
- Incident served as a readiness validation exercise


## SOC Performance Insight
Detection capabilities were adequate; however, response speed was limited by manual verification and decision-making.
