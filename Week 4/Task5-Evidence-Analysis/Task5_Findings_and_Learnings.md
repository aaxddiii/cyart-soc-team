# Task 5 – Findings and Learnings

## Key Findings
- Most SOC evidence is volatile and time-sensitive
- Not all investigations involve malware or compromise
- Understanding baseline system behavior is critical


## Challenges Faced
- No dedicated Windows VM for endpoint evidence
- Limited tooling for full disk forensics
- Focus shifted to live-response analysis


## Learnings
- Live evidence must be handled carefully
- Documentation is as important as detection
- Even clean findings are valuable in investigations
- Evidence analysis supports decision-making, not assumptions
