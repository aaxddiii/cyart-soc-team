# Week 4 

**Platform:** MacBook M2 + Ubuntu VM (internal SSD) + Windows VM (external HDD optional)  
**Primary Tools Used:** Elastic/Kibana, AlienVault OTX, TheHive (Docker), Linux network utilities (ss/netstat), hashing (sha256sum)

## Overview (What I Completed)
This repository contains Week 4 SOC tasks with step-by-step workflows, evidence, and reports:
- Task 1: Threat Hunting (Elastic + OTX)
- Task 2: SOAR Playbook (documented workflow)
- Task 3: Post-Incident Analysis (5 Whys + metrics)
- Task 4: Alert Triage + Case Management (TheHive)
- Task 5: Evidence Analysis (volatile data + chain-of-custody)
- Task 6: Adversary Emulation (MITRE mapping + detection gaps)
- Task 7: Metrics + Executive Reporting
- Task 8: Capstone (SANS-style report + executive briefing)

## Evidence Rules Followed
- Screenshots are from my own environment (Ubuntu VM / TheHive UI / Kibana UI).
- Evidence files are preserved with hashes where applicable (Task 5).
- Each task folder contains:
  - `TaskX_Workflow.md` (step-by-step)
  - `TaskX_*.pdf` report(s)
  - `screenshots/` evidence
