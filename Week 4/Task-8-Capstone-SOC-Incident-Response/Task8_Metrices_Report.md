# SOC Metrics Report – Task 8

## Metrics Summary

| Metric     | Value   |
|------------|---------|
| MTTD       | 2 hours |
| MTTR       | 4 hours |
| Dwell Time | 2 hours |


## Analysis
Detection was timely, but response was slowed by manual validation. Automation would significantly reduce MTTR and operational risk.


## SOC Performance Insight
The SOC demonstrates adequate detection maturity but requires improved automation and response orchestration.
