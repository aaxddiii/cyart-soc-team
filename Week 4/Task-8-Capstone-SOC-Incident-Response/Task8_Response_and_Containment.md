# Response and Containment – Task 8

## Response Strategy
Due to the simulated nature of the incident, response actions focused on procedural validation rather than live containment.


## Containment Actions
- Simulated IP blocking via CrowdSec logic
- Endpoint isolation considered
- User awareness and email filtering review recommended


## Verification
Containment effectiveness was validated through:
- Absence of repeated alerts
- No further suspicious outbound connections
