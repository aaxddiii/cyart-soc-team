# Incident Response Report – Capstone Project

## Executive Summary
A simulated phishing incident was detected and handled through standard SOC processes to evaluate detection, response, and reporting
effectiveness. The SOC successfully identified the threat, performed triage, and documented findings without operational impact.

## Timeline
- 10:00 – Phishing email delivered
- 12:00 – Alert detected
- 12:15 – Case created
- 16:00 – Response actions validated
- 17:00 – Incident closed

## Analysis
Threat intelligence enrichment confirmed the malicious nature of the indicator. No evidence of lateral movement or system compromise was observed.

## Root Cause
The incident originated from a phishing email that bypassed initial filtering due to previously unknown indicators.

## Recommendations
- Enhance email security controls
- Automate threat intelligence ingestion
- Improve SOAR response playbooks

## Conclusion
The SOC demonstrated effective detection and documentation capabilities. Process improvements would further reduce response time and operational risk.
