# Task 8 – Capstone SOC Incident Response Workflow

## Objective
To simulate an end-to-end SOC incident response lifecycle, integrating detection, triage, response, analysis, adversary emulation reasoning, and executive reporting.


## Incident Scenario
A simulated phishing attack was used as the primary incident vector, followed by potential lateral movement and remote service exploitation indicators.


## SOC Lifecycle Covered
1. Detection via SIEM (Elastic)
2. Alert triage and case creation (TheHive)
3. Threat intelligence enrichment (OTX)
4. Response and containment planning
5. Root cause analysis
6. Metrics evaluation
7. Executive reporting


## Constraints
- No live exploitation performed
- Adversary behavior simulated using MITRE ATT&CK
- Focus on detection readiness and SOC process maturity
