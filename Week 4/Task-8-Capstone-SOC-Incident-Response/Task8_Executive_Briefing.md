# Executive Briefing – Capstone Incident

A simulated phishing incident was used to assess SOC readiness and response effectiveness. The threat was detected within two hours
and response actions were validated within four hours. No business impact occurred.

The exercise highlighted strong visibility into threats but also identified opportunities to improve response speed through automation.
Investing in automated threat intelligence and response workflows would significantly reduce future risk.

Overall, the SOC is operationally capable, with clear pathways for maturity improvement.
