Objective:
To understand how SOC dashboards provide visibility into security events and trends.

Process Followed:
Dashboard concepts were studied using Kibana and Grafana examples. The following visualizations were identified as essential for SOC monitoring:

Dashboards Studied
Top 10 source IP addresses generating alerts
Frequency of critical security Event IDs
Authentication failure trends over time

Pre-built dashboards and Sigma detection rule examples were reviewed to understand how detection logic is visualized in real SOC environments.
Outcome:
Dashboards enable analysts to quickly identify abnormal activity patterns and prioritize investigations.
