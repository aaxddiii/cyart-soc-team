Objective:
To analyze Windows Security logs in order to detect suspicious authentication activity and system changes.

Process Followed:
Windows Event Viewer was used to filter and analyze security-related events. The focus was on identifying failed login attempts and unauthorized service creation, which are common
indicators of brute-force attacks or persistence techniques.

Event IDs Analyzed:
Event ID 4625: Failed login attempts
Event ID 7045: New service creation

By filtering Event ID 4625 in the Security logs, multiple failed login attempts from the same source were observed within a short time frame. 
This behavior is commonly associated with brute-force or password-guessing attacks.

Observation:
Repeated authentication failures from a single IP or user account indicate potential brute-force activity and require further investigation or alerting.
