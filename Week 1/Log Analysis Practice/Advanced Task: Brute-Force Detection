Objective:
To simulate and detect brute-force login attempts using Windows Security logs.

Process Followed:
Multiple failed login attempts were generated on a Windows virtual machine using incorrect passwords.
Windows Event Viewer was filtered for Event ID 4625.

Events were reviewed to identify patterns such as repeated failures from the same source.

Filtered events were exported to CSV format for documentation and analysis.

Result:
The exported log data clearly showed repeated failed login attempts, confirming brute-force behavior patterns.
