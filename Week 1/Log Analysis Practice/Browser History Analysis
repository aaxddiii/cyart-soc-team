Objective:
To understand browser artifact analysis and identify potentially malicious URLs accessed by a user.

Process Followed:
Eric Zimmerman’s browser forensics tools were studied to understand how Chrome history files can be parsed. The focus was on
identifying suspicious or test URLs that could indicate phishing or malicious browsing activity.

Advanced Task:
Chrome browser history artifacts were reviewed.
A test URL such as http://test.com was searched within parsed browser history output.
The exercise demonstrated how SOC analysts can identify malicious or suspicious browsing behavior during investigations.
