Objective:
To detect repeated SSH authentication failures using Wazuh.

Rule Logic:
Detect 3 or more failed SSH logins within 2 minutes
Trigger alert when threshold is exceeded

Testing Method:
Failed SSH login attempts were simulated using incorrect credentials (ssh user@192.168.1.x). Alert behavior and effectiveness were 
reviewed conceptually using Wazuh documentation and sample outputs.

Alert Validation:
The rule logic was documented and evaluated based on its ability to reduce false positives while detecting real brute-force attempts.
