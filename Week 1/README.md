## ⚠️ Lab Execution Note

This week’s tasks were performed in a constrained lab environment using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on Oracle VirtualBox along with a Windows virtual
machine for event and log analysis. Due to legacy OS limitations and compatibility issues, some modern SOC tools could not be fully executed.
Therefore, the focus of this week was placed on understanding SOC workflows, log analysis techniques, alert logic, and proper documentation,
which reflects real-world SOC intern responsibilities.

## 🔐 Objectives of Week 1

- Understand SOC fundamentals and analyst roles  
- Practice log analysis using Windows Event Logs  
- Learn how brute-force attacks are detected  
- Document security events professionally  
- Understand alert rules and monitoring dashboards
